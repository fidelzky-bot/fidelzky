  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is vibe coding?",
      "answer": "Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy, refers to an AI-first approach to software development where programmers interact with AI tools instead of manually writing most of the code. It relies on prompting AI agents, AI-assisted debugging, and rapid iteration with minimal concern for deep technical details."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does vibe coding differ from traditional coding?",
      "answer": "Vibe coding focuses on prompting AI agents and accepting AI-generated solutions, while traditional coding involves manually writing and structuring code, deeply understanding system logic, and carefully architecting software for scalability and maintainability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is vibe coding faster than traditional coding?",
      "answer": "Yes, vibe coding dramatically accelerates development. Applications can be built in hours or days instead of weeks. Y Combinator's 2025 startup batch reported that 25% of founders built 95% of their codebases using AI-generated code."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the main advantages of vibe coding?",
      "answer": "Vibe coding offers unmatched speed, rapid prototyping, and low barrier to entry. You don't need a formal computer science background, and AI tools handle syntax, logic, and debugging. Replit CEO Amjad Masad stated that 75% of Replit users never write a single line of code—they simply describe what they want."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will vibe coding replace traditional developers?",
      "answer": "Not completely. The future is hybrid: vibe coding will dominate early-stage development and prototyping, while traditional coding remains essential for critical applications, infrastructure, cybersecurity, and large-scale systems. Developers will act more as AI copilots, guiding AI tools while maintaining human oversight."
